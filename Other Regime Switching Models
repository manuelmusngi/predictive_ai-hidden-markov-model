#### Stochastic Volatility with Regime-Switching Models
Heston Model with Regime-Switching: Volatility follows a stochastic process, but switches regimes based on a Markov chain.

GARCH with Regime-Switching: Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models with different volatility regimes.

#### Machine Learning-Based Regime-Switching Models
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with Bayesian Estimation: Uses machine learning techniques to estimate regime probabilities.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs: Capture regime shifts using time series memory mechanisms.

Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs): Clusters financial time series into different regimes based on probability distributions.

#### Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) Models
These models define regimes based on threshold levels of a variable (e.g., if volatility is above a certain threshold, it switches to a high-volatility regime).

Self-Exciting TAR (SETAR): Extends the TAR model by allowing for multiple regimes with different autoregressive processes.

#### Smooth Transition Models
Smooth Transition Autoregressive (STAR) Models: Regimes change gradually rather than abruptly based on a logistic or exponential function.

Useful when market transitions are not sudden but evolve smoothly over time.

#### Change-Point Detection Models
Bayesian Change-Point Models: Use Bayesian inference to detect structural breaks in market conditions.

CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) and Sequential Analysis: Identify shifts in mean returns or volatility over time.
